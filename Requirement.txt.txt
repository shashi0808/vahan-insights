Objective: 
Build a simple interactive dashboard (UI) focused on vehicle registration data, 
with the investor's perspective in mind. (You can use AI) 
Your Task: 
1. Data Source 
○ Use the public data from Vahan Dashboard 
○ Focus on: 
■ Vehicle type-wise data (2W/3W/4W) 
■ Manufacturer-wise registration data 
2. Key Requirements: 
○ Display YoY (Year-over-Year) and QoQ 
(Quarter-over-Quarter) growth for: 
■ Total vehicles by category 
■ Each manufacturer 
○ Build a clean, investor-friendly UI using Streamlit or Dash. 
○ Features should include: 
■ Date range selection 
■ Filters by vehicle category/manufacturer 
■ Graphs showing trends and % change 
3. Technical Expectations: 
○ Use Python for data processing and dashboard development 
○ SQL for data manipulation (if applicable) 
○ Document any scraping or data collection steps 
○ Keep the code modular, readable, and version-controlled (GitHub 
preferred) 
4.  Submission Requirements: 
○ Record a short screen recording (max 5 minutes) explaining: 
■ What you built 
■ How to use the dashboard 
■ Key investor insights you discovered 
○ Upload the video (YouTube unlisted/Drive link acceptable) and share 
it with your submission 
5. Final Submission Should Include: 
○ GitHub repo or code files 
○ README with: 
■ Setup instructions 
■ Data assumptions 
■ Feature roadmap (if continued) 
○ Video walkthrough link 
Bonus: 
Share any valuable investment insight or a surprising trend you noticed while 
working on the data.
